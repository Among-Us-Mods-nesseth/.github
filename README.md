## 🧬 What Are Among Us Mods?

Mods are custom-coded tweaks that run on top of the base game, giving players **new abilities, rules, maps**, and **completely different win conditions**.

You can turn a regular match into a full roleplay session or an all-out power game — **no more basic crewmate vs impostor**. With the right mod, you can:

* Become an **engineer with vents**
* Eliminate crewmates as a **jester trying to get voted out**
* Protect players as a **guardian angel**
* Turn invisible, shapeshift, shoot, freeze, teleport — it's all possible
